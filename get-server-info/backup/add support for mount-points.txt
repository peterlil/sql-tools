The only way I know of is using the Win32 API to help.

You open a handle to the volume using Win32_Volume.DeviceID, modified slightly. You can open a handle to the volume using the format:
\\.\Volume{[GUID]} 

 You then need to issue IOCTL_VOLUME_GET_VOLUME_DISK_EXTENTS on the open handle to retrieve a VOLUME_DISK_EXTENTS structure. This structure will contain a list of physical disk ids for the volume.

Using these disk ids you can query WMI on Win32_DiskDrive.Index to get the matching disk.
